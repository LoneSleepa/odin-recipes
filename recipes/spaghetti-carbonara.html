    <h1>Spaghetti Carbonara</h1>
      <img src="../img/spaghetti-carbonara.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This is a favorite supper dish that's quick and easy to make. I double it for our family of 4 growing boys.</br> We serve it all up and then add on the goodies that are left in the bottom of the bowl - there's always bacon and eggs left down there.</p>
      
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 pound bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>4 eggs, well beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup of grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup olive oil</li>
      </ul>
      
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, reserving some of the drippings, crumble and set aside.</li>
        <li>Scramble eggs in bacon drippings.</li>
        <li>Place spaghetti in a large bowl. Pour in olive oil, and mix well; use enough to just moisten spaghetti. 
            Stir in bacon, eggs, and Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
