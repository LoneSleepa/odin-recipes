    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This striking looking dish is basically a potato, onion, and bacon casserole, topped with Reblochon cheese.</p>
      
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>3 pounds whole russet potatoes</li>
        <li>12 ounces thick cut bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>3/4 cup creme fraiche</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounces) round Reblochon cheese or other ripe, washed rind cheese</li>
      </ul>
      
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Boil unpeeled potatoes with salt in water over high heat; reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are easily pierced with a knife<br> but are not too soft, 15 to 25 minutes depending on size. Remove potatoes from water to cool.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a skillet over medium to medium-high heat until cooked but not quite crisp and most of the fat is rendered out,<br> 5 to 7 minutes. Push bacon to one side of the pan and blot up some of the fat with a wadded paper towel.<br> Add onion slices. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper and cayenne. Cook and stir over medium heat<br> until onions are soft, sweet, and golden, about 6 minutes. Add white wine; cook for 2 minutes and deglaze pan. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Cut wheel of cheese into 2 semi-circles. Place each half cut side down and split in half to form 2 more semi-circles, each with<br> a rind side and creamy cheese side.</li>
        <li>When potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel off the skin. Slice into fairly thick slices, about 1/3 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Place a little over half the potato slices onto bottom<br> of a 2-quart shallow baking dish. A little overlapping is fine. Sprinkle<br> with a bit of salt. Pour in bacon/onion/wine<br> mixture and spread over potatoes in an even layer. Arrange the remaining potato slices over the top, overlapping as needed. Spread <br>creme fraiche over the potatoes. Place down cheese pieces, rind side up. Transfer pan to a baking sheet.<br> Bake in center rack of preheated oven until browned and potatoes are tender, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
      </ol>
